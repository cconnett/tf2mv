Team Fortress 2 Market Values
=============================

This project consists of three components:

* A sourcemod plugin which adds item_found events to the game log.
* A python module for analyzing trades and determining average market values.
* A website built with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to show market
  values, and related applications of market values.

Sourcemod plugin (plugin)
-------------------------

This is a very simple Sourcemod plugin that hooks the "item_found"
game event and posts the event to a trade collection webservice on
tf2mv.com.  Trades are periodically analyzed with the analyzer.

This plugin requires the cURL sourcemod extention.

Python analyzer (analyzer)
--------------------------

This is a Python module that analyzes the data collected from servers
running the Sourcemod plugin.  It collects the raw item_found events
into a database, calculates trades and derives market values using a
non-negative least squares optimization to minimize the residuals on
the system of equations defined by all trades on record (each trade is
considered an equation).

The website (website and public)
--------------------------------

This is all the code and resources behind tf2mv.com.
